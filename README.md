# Simon game by ChennaSaiPrakash

Dive into the mesmerizing world of Simon, a JavaScript-powered memory game that challenges players to recall colors from start to finish. With a sleek interface and dynamic gameplay, each level presents a new twist to keep you on your toes. Compete for high scores and immerse yourself in a symphony of sound as you strive for 
victory.

# Here's a step-by-step guide to playing the Simon game:

Click on the "Start" button to begin the game. Simon will generate a random color sequence. Let's say the first color generated is yellow.

Click on the yellow color to repeat the sequence. Simon will then generate another color sequence. If, for example, it generates blue as the second color, click on yellow first and then blue to continue the sequence.

Simon will keep generating new colors to add to the sequence. Each time, you must repeat the sequence correctly. For example, if the sequence so far is yellow, blue, and it generates green next, you would click on yellow, then blue, then green to continue.

If you make a mistake and click the wrong color, the game will end, and your score will be displayed as the highest number of correct colors in a sequence.

To start a new game or restart, click on the "Restart" or "Start New Game" button.
